    "# Using a TensorNode class to insert a network built with the Tensorflow Keras API into a Nengo model\n",
    "This tutorial builds on [Inserting a TensorFlow network into a Nengo model](./pretrained-model.ipynb). In that tutorial, we showed how to write a TensorNode class that makes it easy to insert a pre-trained network from `tf.contrib.slim` into a Nengo model.  \n",
    "Sometimes, instead of using a pre-trained network, you may want to use your own neural net architecture within a TensorNode. Here we show how a network built with the `tf.keras` API can be insterted into a Nengo model using the TensorNode class. If you haven't read the previous tutorial, please work through that one to familiarize yourself with the concept we'll use here. This tutorial also assumes familiarity with the `tf.keras` API. Specifically it is based on the [introduction in the Tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification), so if you are not yet familiar with Keras, you may find it helpful to read those tutorials first as well."

We also use the `post_build` method where we can load the weights, after our network has been built as a dataflow graph that `Tensorflow` can execute within its C++ runtime.

This way the returned `Tensor` can become part of the dataflow graph that Tensorflow creates for its C++ runtime when acting as the Nengo backend."
